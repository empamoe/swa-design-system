## Introduction

The details pane is a supplement to the main content area that is used to provide users a way to view more detailed information and interact with an entity while keeping the main view in the content area.
The details pane appears when clicking on one entity in an overview of many entities (e.g. on a device in a table).

## Principles

**Preview**
The details pane summarizes the most important content of the selected element.

**No editing**
Editing of data (e.g. changing device name) is not allowed inside a details pane. In contrast the single view usually shows all data in editing mode.

**Use actions sparingly**
Some actions concerning the entity (e.g. deactivating a strategy) may be offered inside the details pane. Since it only contains the most important content, actions should also be chosen considerately.


## When to Use
Generally a details pane is always available on pages where the content only consists of a listing of many entities.

**Use if**
- you want to show additional information for entities in the main content area.

**Do not use if**
- the respective entity is not in the main content area.
- to show additional information pertaining to the  main content area as a whole.

## Anatomy

2. Hide Button
3. Details Box Header
4. Details Box Content

## Placement

<img src={DetailsPanePlacement} alt="DetailsPanePlacement" />

Details panes are anchored to the right edge of the screen (3). The details pane is divided in 5 columns. The content of the details boxes aligns to the grid.
The top of the title always aligns to the top of the content.

### Mobile (xs)
There is no sidebar in tables. You can only access a preview on the map.

## Measurements

The width is calculated through the viewport size. Details panes span the height of the content area.

## Elevation
The details pane is placed on the background layer.

## Variations

A user may select multiple items in the content area by using Ctrl + click / cmd + click. These are marked active and show up in the details pane as a list as shown here. Another way to select multiple items is when a user clicks an aggregated icon on the map. Users can then batch interact with these multiple items (e.g. creating a group; deactivating all of them)

When multiple devices have been selected there should be actions available that are often needed by users.

## Multiselection

## Behavior and Interaction

### Interactions

**Opening**
On any content area that displays a collection of entities the details pane appears once I click on one of the entities. Selecting multiple entities will change the view and show a grouped list of all objects.

**Closing**
The details pane may be closed by clicking the close icon freeing space toward the content area.
A closed pane can be viewed by clicking again on the entity or by using the keyboard shortcut   d.

**Collapsing of Detail Boxes**
Individual detail boxes may be collapsed (hidden) or expanded by clicking the detail box header or the collapse/expand icon. By default all sections are expanded.

**Scrolling**
Details panes can be vertically scrolled independent of the rest of the UI.
They cannot be horizontally scrolled.
